Biomarkers of Major Depressive Disorder: An Analysis of Macro-Scale Cortical Gradients
=======================================
 This study relies on an [extensive, freely available dataset](http://rfmri.org/REST-meta-MDD). [(Yan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1900390116) To run the analyses on your computer:

 1. Send a data access request & sign the data use agreement.
 2. Change the directory to `jupyter_book`: `cd .../Rest-MDD-Gradients/jupyter_book`.
 3. Install the required packages like so: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt `
 4. Retrieve & place to `Rest-MDD-Gradients/jupyter_book`: 
    - the folder with fMRI timeseries: `REST-meta-MDD-Phase1-Sharing/Results/ROISignals_FunImgARCWF` (no GSR);
    -  the .xlsx file containing the phenotypic data of participants.
 5. Run the Jupyter Notebooks.
 
The whole project can be viewed in the Jupyter Book: download the repository and access the file `index.html` at `Rest-MDD-Gradients/jupyter_book/_build/html/index.html`
