# Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition involving such symptoms as negative self-focused rumination and overly pessimistic attitudes towards life events. By and large, previous studies relied on seed-based functional connectivity analyses to describe neural correlates of MDD. Despite being theoretically sound and widely accepted in the academic medium, these methods focus on specific regions. Hence, they do not suffice to build an integral, global account of changes in functional connectivity in the cortex. Here, we implemented an approach based on macroscale cortical gradients with the aim of probing the resting state fMRI data of 1274 Chinese subjects for biomarkers of MDD.

We observed an expansion of higher-order associative (i.e. transmodal) regions in drug-naïve patients with MDD along the first gradient. However, we found no difference between subjects on medication and controls which suggests the underlying effect of medication. Along the second gradient, we detected a shift of the right angular gyrus and right paracingulate cortex towards the default mode network (DMN) in the drug-naïve group. In the subjects on medication, the right operculum cortex overlapping with the ventral attention network, was shifted towards the DMN.

Relying on relatively novel methodology, we demonstrate that the aforementioned aberrations, as reflected in changes in functional connectivity patterns spanning across the entire cortex, may putatively represent biomarkers of MDD. By extension, we show that macroscale cortical gradients constitute a valid method needed to globally assess the impact of psychopathology, and namely MDD, on the human brain.
