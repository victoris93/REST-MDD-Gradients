# Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychopathological condition characterized by a dramatic change in affective and cognitive functioning, having a substantial negative effect on everyday life. The most frequently reported symptoms comprise loss of interest in activities previously regarded as pleasurable and amplified negative emotional states, which tend to persist for days, weeks and even months {cite:p}`american_psychiatric_association_diagnostic_2013`.

Despite recent technological and methodological advancements in cognitive neuroscience, the field has not yet settled on a singular explanation of the etiology of MDD. However, the existing body of literature does provide a plausible theoretical account of the emergence of this condition on the cerebral level: namely, the limbic-cortical dysintegration model proposed by {cite:t}`mayberg_modulating_2003`. The model postulates that depression results from a disruption of limbic and cortical pathways. Clinical trials testing deep brain stimulation on depressed patients provide an argument in favor of this model: the delivery of focal electrical current to subcallosal cingulate cortex alters circuits projecting from it, thereby alleviating symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. {cite:p}`mayberg_targeted_2009` These results are in line with the emphasis the model places on the complex nature of the underlying disruption: it cannot be located in any single region or attributed to a specific class of synapses.

More recently, in accordance with Mayberg's model, alterations in functional connectivity as well as activation patterns within the default mode network (DMN: {cite:p}`thomas_yeo_organization_2011`) have been observed in individuals diagnosed with MDD. The regions commonly referred to as DMN constituents are ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, lateral parietal cortex (LPC) and entorhinal cortex. {cite:p}`spreng_patterns_2010` This network has been consistently shown to be activated in higher-order cognitive processes pertaining to self-generated thought, episodic memory, reflection and other forms of mind-wandering. {cite:p}`buckner_self-projection_2007,raichle_default_2001,spreng_patterns_2010` The hypothesis linking the DMN and depression relies on the positive association between higher DMN dominance over task-positive networks in patients diagnosed with MDD and higher levels of maladaptive self-focused negative rumination. {cite:p}`hamilton_default-mode_2011` Thus, greater within-DMN functional connectivity was observed in depressed individuals compared to healthy controls. {cite:p}`greicius_resting-state_2007,zhou_increased_2010,wu_default-mode_2011,scalabrini_all_2020`) Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) results in reduced functional connectivity in the DMN {cite:p}`yan_reduced_2019`. These results are in line with the axis of research on classical serotonergic psychedelics which, akin to SSRIs, target 5-HT receptors and therefore induce a decrease in within-DMN functional connectivity. {cite:p}`carhart-harris_neural_2012,muller_altered_2018`

The importance of these advancements notwithstanding, these approaches do not allow for an investigation on the scale of the whole brain. As shown in {cite:t}`scalabrini_all_2020`, aberrations in functional connectivity within the DMN can originate outside of the network. In the case of classical seed-based functional connectivity analyses, the inability to capture the entirety of connectivity alterations across the whole cortex hinders the interpretation of the results. The objective of the present study was to provide a more holistic, global account of alterations in functional connectivity patterns on the scale of the whole brain. To this end, we analyzed macroscale cortical gradients. {cite:p}`margulies_situating_2016`

A macroscale cortical gradient represents a continuum spanning across the cortex and capturing variance in functional connectivity. {cite:p}`margulies_situating_2016,huntenburg_large-scale_2018` More specifically, the relative position of a voxel (or region) along the gradient is defined by the density and distance of its connections to the rest of the brain. Thus, the regions which share more connections, are located closer to each other along the gradient. The choice of this method is based on the fact that it treats voxels (or regions) as elements having a specific position along gradients of functional connectivity thereby allowing for an interpretation on the scale of the whole brain in spite of inferential methods being focused on specific regions.

It has been postulated that the first two gradients explaining the largest fraction of variability in functional connectivity represent two intrinsic spatial dimensions of the cortex. The first or the principal gradient spans from unimodal sensorimotor areas to transmodal areas (DMN) reflecting a functional hierarchy inherent to the cortex: the regions implicated in sensory processing are maximally distant from the regions associated with higher-order functions such as social cognition and reasoning. The second gradient captures the dimension spanning across sensory modalities: visual, auditory and somatosensory/motor. These observations are in line with the fact that those regions which are situated the farthest from each other across the principal gradient are also spatially separated by the longest geodesic distance (figure 1: {cite:p}`margulies_situating_2016`).

The approach based on macroscale cortical gradients is relatively novel and therefore, to date, only a few studies have touched upon their role as a possible biomarker of certain pathologies. {cite:t}`hong_atypical_2019` observed a suppressed uni- to transmodal cortical gradient in autistic subjects which indicates a diminished functional segregation between sensorimotor areas and the DMN. Along the same lines, {cite:t}`dong_compressed_2021` reported a compressed uni- to transmodal gradient in schizophrenia patients compared to controls, with the effect being more pronounced in sensorimotor regions. However, to date, no studies have examined the relation between macroscale cortical organization and MDD.

The present study relied on the large-scale dataset provided by the REST-meta-MDD consortium ({cite:p}`yan_reduced_2019`; access: http://rfmri.org/REST-meta-MDD). To extract cortical gradients, we applied generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA, {cite:p}`afshin-pour_enhancing_2012,sorensen_generalized_2021`) to already available fMRI timeseries. Since only cortical regions were of interest, we used Harvard-Oxford cortical probabilistic atlas. The values obtained from GCCA for each region were subsequently compared between drug-naïve depressed subjects and healthy controls by means of a permuted ordinary least squares (OLS) model.

In light of the existing evidence, we expected drug-naïve patients diagnosed with MDD to have an expanded transmodal spectrum in the first gradient. In other words, we expected to observe an overall shift of gradient scores in drug-naïve subjects towards the transmodal end of the gradient, the DMN. This shift would indicate that the concerned regions would be functionally closer to the DMN in drug-naïve patients than in controls. In particular, the shift would imply higher functional connectivity between these regions and the DMN. This hypothesis is intuitively plausible in that expanded associative regions could constitute a neurological substrate of excessive self-referential rumination. 

We hypothesized an aberrant macroscale cortical hierarchy in drug-naïve (DN) participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder compared to normal controls (NC). Overall, we expected transmodal regions to be expanded with some regions being functionally closer to the DMN in the depressed, drug-naïve group. Quantitatively, this hypothesis implies that the gradient score of the concerned regions would obtain a score which would situate them closer to the transmodal end of the first gradient.

As for the subjects on medication (MED), we hypothesized a reverse trend in that the gradient score of the transmodal regions would be more dispersed than in controls. This latter hypothesis relies on the findings in {cite:t}`yan_reduced_2019` whereby individuals with recurrent MDD on medication exhibited lower functional connectivity within the DMN than the control group.

However, we put forward no specific hypothesis with regards to the second gradient due to the lack of available insight in the literature. Therefore, we conducted exploratory analyses on the second gradient involving the same groups and methods as in the case of the first gradient.
